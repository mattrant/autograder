# Autograder Script

This script can be used with Autolab software for automatic grading of software. Currently only compiled languages are supported for use with this script. In the future changes will be made to allow for use of interpreted languages as well. There will also later be an addition for use of command line arguments.

A user manual can be found here:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TqWTJw4A20Qh2En2GP1Eww8WYAkSyEqHl2waPhc4n0M/edit?usp=sharing

This documentation will be continuously updated and will most likely be incorporated as a standalone file that will be included in this repository in the future.
