All tests for the autograder should be divided into logical directories and placed at this level in the repository. Each folder should contain a file called run_tests.sh that will automatically run all tests that are present inside the folder. These files will be called from a file called run_all_tests.sh that will be present in the top-level directory. Each run_test.sh file should immediately print out the name of the folder that that is having its tests executed. Cleanup of all unnecessary files should be performed after every test run. It is recommended to perform this functionality in run_tests.sh
