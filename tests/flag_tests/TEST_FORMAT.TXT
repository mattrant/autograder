Unfortunately there is no structured way to currently test the autograder command line flags. Currently the only way to test is to set up your test with whatever files it needs in this directory and manually add the code to test the correctness of the program when the flag is entered. Please follow the format of printing out a green check mark after a test that has returned successfully and printing out a red X after tests that have not returned correctly.
