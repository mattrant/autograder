C is a computer programming language developed by Dennis M. Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at Bell Labs.
Both C and C++ will be covered in this course.
To become an excellent programmer, the only way is to practice.
Many later languages have borrowed directly or indirectly from C, including C++, D, Go, Rust, Java, JavaScript, Limbo, LPC, C#, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, Python, Swift, Verilog (hardware description language), and Unix's C shell.
