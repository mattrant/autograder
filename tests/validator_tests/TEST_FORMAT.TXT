All tests should be added as a standalone grading key in the format grading_key.txt-<identifier>. The identifier and the correct return result should be placed in the correct_results dictionary at the top of the validator_test_script.py file. The identifier in the grading_key filename will be used to match the output of that test to the correct return value in the correct_results dictionary. The identifier will be used as the key into the dictionary.
